# kat

Scriptable session manager for the kitty terminal emulator.

(WIP and busted rn)

## Overview

Kitty supports [remote control](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control.html).
With this enabled, we can create a DSL to send commands to kitty. We can open
tabs, run programs, and do anything your shell could do.

Built on top of the [Molt Tcl interpreter](https://github.com/wduquette/molt).
